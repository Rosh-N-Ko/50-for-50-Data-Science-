First thing u have to do is to make a firm and strong decision whether u really wanna do CP or not.\\nReason why I am telling u this is because many people just do it because their classmates are doing CP and they appear to be alien in that field which is not the correct reason to do something.\\nLet me tell u one thing very honestly if u want job in product based companies of Software development engineer position u need to have good problem solving skills at any cost whatsoever and excellent knowledge of Data Structures and Algorithms.\\nIf u are doing CP like I opened my laptop today and I am opening it after 20 days it\\'s not gonna work like that way if ur serious about CP then u have to chalk a good week plan be consistent and steadfast in it.\\nSometimes it may happen that u become demotivated and left CP for a month or so BUT it should happen only sometimes and u should try to come back as soon as possible\\n2.

Many people will tell u that u don\\'t need to take any placement course right now there is much time for campus placement but according to my experience it\\'s better if u take a course and start preparing right away from placement point of u because till next year u can become not only a good programmer but also u will be prepared thoroughly for Campus interviews.\\nWhat u need to know about placements is that cracking interviews and CP are different things in interviews they don\\'t expect or even bother whether ur a super competitive programmer or a 1 star programmer(although mentioning hackerRank Ranks, codechef ratings will ofcourse give golden layer to ur resume) But what they expect from u is u should be able to solve the interview problems with optimised solutions and try to think even if ur not able to solve the problem.\\n17/03/2020, 1:17 pm - +91 73043 57388: About courses \\nI will tell u bit later\\n17/03/2020, 1:18 pm - +91 73043 57388: This are few messages that I posted on my group for Guidance to CP.\\nNot an exhaustive approach.

An opening parenthesis and a closing parenthesis that is further to its right are said to match if their nesting is empty, or if every parenthesis in their nesting matches with another parenthesis in their nesting. The nesting depth of a position p is the number of pairs of matching parentheses m such that p is included in the nesting of m.\\nFor example, in the following strings, all digits match their nesting depth: 0((2)1), (((3))1(2)), ((((4)))), ((2))((2))(1). The first three strings have minimum length among those that have the same digits in the same order, but the last one does not since ((22)1) also has the digits 221 and is shorter.\\nGiven a string of digits S, find another string S\\', comprised of parentheses and digits, such that:\\nall parentheses in S\\' match some other parenthesis,\\nremoving any and all parentheses from S\\' results in S,\\neach digit in S\\' is equal to its nesting depth, and\\nS\\' is of minimum length.\\nInput\\nThe first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T.

In addition, 1)( and )(1 are not valid solutions to Sample Case #4 because they contain unmatched parentheses and the nesting depth is 0 at the position where there is a 1.\\nYou can create sample inputs that are valid only for Test Set 2 by removing the parentheses from the example strings mentioned in the problem statement.\\n05/04/2020, 5:18 pm - +91 97681 67131: Anyone got solution to this?\\n05/04/2020, 5:19 pm - +91 82916 21138: Use stack\\n05/04/2020, 5:20 pm - Rishab Saini (TSEC CS, TE): No need to use that too\\nJust a counter and an empty string\\'s enough\\n05/04/2020, 5:21 pm - Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE): U solved it using stack?\\n05/04/2020, 5:21 pm - +91 97681 67131: In python converting it to str to list and since lists are like vectors i manuplate it and then at last convert it to str back\\n05/04/2020, 5:22 pm - +91 97681 67131: Is what I thought\\n05/04/2020, 5:22 pm - +91 97681 67131: Nope\\n05/04/2020, 5:22 pm - +91 82916 21138: I did not give today\\'s mashup but I saw similar kind of stuff\\n05/04/2020, 5:22 pm - Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE): Oh okay\\n05/04/2020, 5:22 pm - +91 82916 21138: But without it it can be done\\n05/04/2020, 5:23 pm - +91 82916 21138: Its good problem but I saw something similar but was bit more high level so they used stack  I got confused and thought it\\'s same problem 🤦🏻\\u200d♂😅\\n05/04/2020, 5:24 pm - Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE): Could be solved by just traversing string..\\n05/04/2020, 5:25 pm - +91 97681 67131: Oh u mean slicing\\n05/04/2020, 5:26 pm - +91 97681 67131: Ya thought of it but how would nesting of brackets work is where I got confused let me try that way\\n05/04/2020, 5:30 pm - +91 82916 21138: Stack will do the work 🤔\\n05/04/2020, 6:31 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I solved using array.\\n\\n```import java.util.*;\\nimport java.math.*;\\n\\n//public class Solution{\\npublic class A{\\n\\tpublic static void main(String[] args){\\n\\t\\tScanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\tchar[] a;\\n\\t\\tStringBuffer o;\\n\\t\\tfor(int t = 0, cases = sc.nextInt();

Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): If you work in an organisation and you need to follow a certain structure, an interface can be used to have uniformity of structure, but difference of implementations.\\n\\nInterfaces help to maintain uniformity and consistency.\\n11/04/2020, 8:42 pm - +91 73043 57388: Interfaces are used when objects have common properties\\n\\nFor example\\nStudents common properties are\\nNane roll no DOB\\nEtc \\nSo student class can be parent class\\nAnd student can be of engineering , medical, pharmacy etc\\nSo these branches becomes child classes\\n11/04/2020, 8:48 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Abstract classes can be used when you want to enforce only certain functions in that class and leave a choice for the other functions to be used or not.\\n\\nThe function signatures without the ```abstract``` keyword in the abstract class do not need to be implemented compulsorily in the class extending the abstract class, but they need to.have an implementation in the abstract class. Their implementation cannot be changed or defined in the class extending the abstract class like the abstract fns\\n11/04/2020, 8:52 pm - +91 73043 57388: Oh sorry this is Inheritance explanation 🤦\\n11/04/2020, 8:53 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Yeah\\n11/04/2020, 9:01 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Usually, interfaces are used to provide INDEPENDENT functionality. Like the ```Iterator``` interface allows objects to be iterated over, and the ```Runnable``` interface allows processes to run in a separate thread. You can have a class that is both iterable, and can run in a separate thread.\\nInterfaces are for things that applicable to a broad range of objects different objects.\\n\\nClasses provide MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE functionality. Like, if you have a ```Stack`` class and a ```Queue``` class. There is no point in creating a ``StackQueue``` class.\\n11/04/2020, 9:04 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Yeah makes sense\\nThank you\\n11/04/2020, 9:04 pm - +91 97681 67131: So a superclass can inherit multiple such interfaces whereas it can only inherit one abstract class right?\\n11/04/2020, 9:07 pm -

+91 99693 94098: Hey everyone,\\nI would like to share with you something that I have been working with for almost 2 months now. In search for efficient medical imaging and diagnosis methods for COVID-19, I worked with radiologists at arterys.com to come up with AI based solutions for faster diagnostic methods. The challenge was to recognise early symptoms of the virus on PA Chest X-rays (since CT scans aren\\'t always available) taken from varying hospitals across the US, China and Italy.\\nAfter extensive research with pretrained and custom models, an ensembled version of both worked well for my case of Opacity detection. This will act as a first stage diagnosis for upcoming pneumonia-like symptoms in patients. The patient will be then advised to get a PCR test done for final confirmation, thereby saving testing kits and securing lives of radiologists who might come in contact with the virus\\nToday I am sharing my repository with all of you to help spread the message about it. I would also like to mention that these results might lead to a few extra false positives due to the reduced threshold but active work is being put in to reduce these errors. The repo consists of a sample keras implementation of the best custom and Resnet models. Also note that training these keras models in the notebook might give different results than the included models because of the custom training loops and pruning methods applied during the original training.\\n\\nRepository Link- https://github.com/DarshanDeshpande/COVID-19-Detector\\n\\nA small version of the dataset on kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/darshan1504/covid19-detection-xray-dataset\\n\\nThank you for your time!\\n30/04/2020, 5:36 pm - +91 80979 84068: Wow @919969394098 !!!\\n30/04/2020, 5:38 pm - +91 77109 79055: Crazy skills @919969394098\\n30/04/2020, 5:40 pm - +91 88284 70904: Wow it\\'s amazing👌🏻👌🏻\\n30/04/2020, 5:42 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): 👍🔥\\n30/04/2020, 5:45 pm - +91 82916 21138: 👍🏻👍🏻🔥🔥🔥🔥\\n30/04/2020, 5:47 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Well done amazing work❤️❤️\\n30/04/2020, 5:48 pm - +91 97681 67131: Wow 🤩👍👍\\n30/04/2020, 5:49 pm - +91 99693 94098: Thanks everyone! ❤️\\n30/04/2020, 6:17 pm - Rishab Saini (TSEC CS, TE): 🙌🏻🔥\\n30/04/2020, 6:24 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Woah!\\n30/04/2020, 6:24 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Good work 👍\\n30/04/2020, 6:32 pm - +91 89764 07509: 💯💯🙌🏻\\n30/04/2020, 6:34 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): This is wow!!\\nGreat work\\n30/04/2020, 7:04 pm - +91 98331 51331: Too good @919969394098\\n30/04/2020, 7:14 pm - Tushar Nankani: Amazing work 🙌🏻🙌🏻 @919969394098\\n30/04/2020, 7:32 pm - +91 99693 94098: Thank you!! 🙌🏻🙏🏻\\n30/04/2020, 7:33 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): Sirrr 🔥@919969394098\\n30/04/2020, 7:41 pm - +91 99693 94098: 😂😂😂\\n30/04/2020, 7:52 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): is it better to implement a Deque using ArrayList or LinkedList?I just wanted to know as im new to DS\\n30/04/2020, 8:42 pm - +91 98331 51331: LinkedList I suppose\\n30/04/2020, 8:42 pm - +91 98331 51331: Easier insertions and deletions of elements\\n30/04/2020, 8:42 pm - +91 98331 51331: Also sorting\\n30/04/2020, 8:43 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Ohk ty\\n30/04/2020, 8:43 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): Why are you implementing Deque\\n30/04/2020, 8:43 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): to solve some qs?\\n30/04/2020, 8:45 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): no just learning it from some article\\n30/04/2020, 8:45 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): i mean in java,you can create a deque object either with ArrayList or LinkedList\\n30/04/2020, 9:09 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): No, sorting is horrible in LinkedList.\\n30/04/2020, 9:15 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yeah\\n30/04/2020, 9:17 pm - +91 98331 51331: Oh my bad\\n30/04/2020, 9:33 pm - +91 73043 57388: But if u practice sorting using linkedlist ur pointer concepts in c/c++ will be sharped and u will become fast with pointers.\\n30/04/2020, 11:28 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I meant performance wise.\\n01/05/2020, 11:47 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): https://www.instagram.com/p/B_omRqOgBCf/?igshid=112w8iyoawgrw\\n01/05/2020, 11:47 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Have a look at this☝️🤯\\n01/05/2020, 12:13 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): https://hownot2code.com/2016/09/02/a-space-error-370-million-for-an-integer-overflow/\\n01/05/2020, 12:22 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): 🤯\\n01/05/2020, 1:37 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): God damn.\\n01/05/2020, 2:13 pm - +91 96648 44643: *UGC* Official Update *29 April 2020*:\\n\\n➡Due to COVID -19, All Universities and colleges remain closed till *30th June*\\n\\n➡End semester exams for final years can be conducted from *1st July* till *31st July*\\n\\n➡Admissions for the year 2020 starts on *1st August* till *31st August*\\n\\n➡Project Reviews, Viva , Dissertation,etc. can be conducted through online from *15th May*\\n\\n➡College sessions will begin in August for current students and September for new ones\\n\\n➡For the academic year 2020-2021 classes will be held 6 days a week (i.e.Monday - Saturday)\\n\\n➡For 1st years and 2nd years there will be no Exams conducted.

I\\'m afraid that something might go wrong. Some strange database behavior has appeared, which leads to slow operation in completely unexpected places (it never was and should not be).

I don\\'t want to risk the efforts of the writer, the coordinator, testers, and your time. Sorry about it, I was trying to fix it for many hours but I need more time. Hope it will be a great round!\\n\\nMike.\\n\\nUPD: I temporarily rescheduled it on May, 6.

Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): But I feel that the only time you should be using libraries is for prototypes, never for the final version of an app/website.\\n28/05/2020, 2:31 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): This way, you aren\\'t really using the library, but you also are ......\\n28/05/2020, 2:31 am -

Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): So I should not use Bootstrap, Materialize CSS, Tailwind CSS, etc for my projects...\\n28/05/2020, 2:33 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Unless the library ADDS critical functionality (eg: PDF parser, WebSocket management) you should think twice before using it.\\n28/05/2020, 2:33 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Oh\\n28/05/2020, 2:34 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Again, the decision is up to you, but I don\\'t like to use these libraries.\\n28/05/2020, 2:34 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): You can achieve the same outcome with 0.1% of the code.\\n28/05/2020, 2:34 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): And I am not even joking, try measuring code coverage in DevTools.\\n28/05/2020, 2:34 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): What is a CDN is used?\\n28/05/2020, 2:34 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): If*\\n28/05/2020, 2:35 am -

Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): What I meant that most (small) projects do not even use 2-5% of the code in a huge library like jQuery or BootStrap.\\n28/05/2020, 2:37 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Agreed, but it only imports the code that is called...\\n\\nNow if you\\'re saying that that code is a lot as compared to when done with vanilla CSS, then you have to be good at that...\\n\\nMy vanilla CSS with flexbox looks like this:\\nhttps://harshkapadia2.github.io/lbl-tribute-page/\\n28/05/2020, 2:37 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): So even if you are using a CDN, and the library is 10,000 lines, then you are only using 100-150 lines.\\n28/05/2020, 2:38 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Which seems like a MASSIVE waste.\\n28/05/2020, 2:38 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): It\\'s so garbage that if I used it in my full stack project, no one would come back to it\\n28/05/2020, 2:38 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): You sure do have a point \\nBut what if, I say I\\'m not really concerned abt frontend \\nI don\\'t want to waste my time adjusting padding and all etc.....\\n\\nI just want to show off my backend functionality.....\\nThen what should I do?\\n28/05/2020, 2:38 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): The entire lib is called even when just a particular class is called?\\n28/05/2020, 2:40 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): If you include a script/library with a <script> or <link> tag, the ENTIRE file is downloaded even if you don\\'t use a single line.\\n28/05/2020, 2:40 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): The Browser does not know what you will use, so it HAS to download, parse and execute the entire library.\\n28/05/2020, 2:40 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Oh yeah 🤦🏻\\u200d♂️\\n28/05/2020, 2:40 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): True true\\n28/05/2020, 2:41 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): However, there is something called \"Tree Shaking\" where unused portions of the library are removed.\\n28/05/2020, 2:42 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): But even that is not as efficient because sometimes one function can call half the library.\\n28/05/2020, 2:42 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Ohh\\n28/05/2020, 2:42 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): And you lose the benefit of a CDN.\\n28/05/2020, 2:43 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): ?\\n28/05/2020, 2:44 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): OK, what backend functionality?\\n28/05/2020, 2:44 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Give me an example.\\n28/05/2020, 2:44 am -

Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Yeahh\\nYou told me once ...\\nNow I remember....\\n28/05/2020, 2:45 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): For v2, we are making the front end ourselves and have redesigned the back end...\\n28/05/2020, 2:47 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): OK, if you are building a REST API, then by all means use BootStrap or Materialize for the demo website.\\n28/05/2020, 2:48 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): But you can still have a great website WITHOUT BootStrap.\\n28/05/2020, 2:48 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Now here we are using Bootstrap and when we add Flexbox, it fucks up the Bootstrap\\n28/05/2020, 2:48 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): No idea what should be done...\\n28/05/2020, 2:49 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Don\\'t use flex box..\\nWhy do you need??\\n28/05/2020, 2:50 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Bootstrap handles it all na?\\n28/05/2020, 2:54 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I try to avoid BootStrap alltogether.\\n28/05/2020, 2:54 am -

Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): The advantage of not using libraries/frameworks is that the website is MUCH lighter, and hence most of the logic can be offloaded to the client.\\n28/05/2020, 3:00 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): It will greatly reduce the load on the server.\\n28/05/2020, 3:00 am -

See bootloader is a integral part of os without its correct flashing device does not work. If ur device came with preunlocked bootloader biggest issue comes with sim locked devices in USA they can be easily exploited and this is how telephone providers were loosing lot of money. This is when moto started with locked bootloader and see xda forums nobody has found exploit for it yet. Also unlocked bootloader gives u permission to flash custom recovery after custom recovery u install custom rom and bam u bypass mi account wala lock and now u can use the stolen phones that’s the reason locked bootloader are better\\n05/06/2020, 6:02 pm - +91 97681 67131: Lineage OS surely would be there as lots of old CYnogen mod developers working on lineage OS and one plus and cynogen go way back\\n05/06/2020, 6:04 pm - +91 88798 05171: tele group nikal na op7 ka, xda doesnt even have an official lineage thread\\n05/06/2020, 6:04 pm - +91 99693 94098: I know this re 😂😂\\nI\\'m saying that all phones have a security check before you can unlock(some kind of login or something) so no random person can do it.

ADB doesn\\'t allow that anyway before you unlock the bootlader\\n05/06/2020, 6:06 pm - +91 99693 94098: https://forum.xda-developers.com/oneplus-7/development/rom-lineageos-17-1-t4109353\\n05/06/2020, 6:06 pm - +91 99693 94098: Infact I know this guy as well.

Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): OK listen.\\n03/09/2020, 12:52 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Ok sir.\\n03/09/2020, 12:52 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Ab khatam😂\\n03/09/2020, 12:53 pm - +91 97027 35002: Idt java me there is something like flushall()\\n03/09/2020, 12:53 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Scanner operates on a token stream, as opposed to BufferedReader, which operates on lines.\\n03/09/2020, 12:54 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): So, imagine Scanner gets the inputs:\\n```10\\\\nHello, World!\\\\n```\\n03/09/2020, 12:54 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Didn\\'t see the code\\n03/09/2020, 12:54 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yes ik\\n03/09/2020, 12:54 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Okay\\n03/09/2020, 12:55 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Now, it is important to understand what the ```nextInt()``` method actually does.\\n03/09/2020, 12:55 pm - +91 97027 35002: Explain sir\\n03/09/2020, 12:55 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): ```nextInt()``` will try to find an *Integer token*, while ignoring any whitespace.\\n03/09/2020, 12:56 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): An Integer token is defined as ```/(+|-)?\\\\d+/```\\n03/09/2020, 12:56 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Meaning + or -, followed by one or more digits.\\n03/09/2020, 12:57 pm - +91 97027 35002: Okay\\n03/09/2020, 12:57 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): So Scanner reads the token stream, finds 10 and returns it.\\n03/09/2020, 12:57 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Now the stream is: ```\\\\nHello, World!\\\\n```\\n03/09/2020, 12:58 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Again, we must understand what the ```nextLine()``` method does.\\n03/09/2020, 12:59 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): ```nextLine()``` is actually a special method, that breaks the boundries of a tokenizer.\\n03/09/2020, 1:00 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): It simply starts reading from the current point, and returns *all characters* till it finds a newline (```\\\\n```).\\n03/09/2020, 1:00 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): (without the newline)\\n03/09/2020, 1:01 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): So calling ```nextLine()``` on ```\\\\nHello, World!\\\\n``` will start reading, the stop at the first character because it is a newline.\\n03/09/2020, 1:01 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): So basically \\nIt returned nothing in my case\\n03/09/2020, 1:01 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Which means it will return an empty string.\\n03/09/2020, 1:01 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Yes.\\n03/09/2020, 1:02 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Alright. \\nGot it.\\nThank you.\\n03/09/2020, 1:02 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): No problem.\\n03/09/2020, 1:02 pm - +91 97027 35002: Ohhhhh\\n03/09/2020, 1:03 pm - +91 97027 35002: Okayyy\\n03/09/2020, 1:10 pm -

But here Integer caching changes the results.Integer class has a caching range of -128 to 127. Whenever a number is between this range and autoboxing is used, it assigns the same reference. That’s why for value 100, both num1 and num2 will have the same reference, but for the value 500 (not in the range of -128 to 127), num3 and num4 will have different reference.\\n13/09/2020, 2:13 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I knew this for String\\n13/09/2020, 2:14 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): String ke liye always same location hota hai\\n13/09/2020, 2:14 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): String pool ki vjh se\\n13/09/2020, 2:14 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): yesssss\\n13/09/2020, 2:14 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Mereko laga ki jo issue hota hai bade numbers mein hota hai issleye smaller number would be true😂\\n13/09/2020, 2:14 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): if you want different String then use String Builder/Buffer\\n13/09/2020, 2:14 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): 😂😂\\n13/09/2020, 2:14 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): 😂👍\\n13/09/2020, 2:14 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Correct\\n13/09/2020, 2:15 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): This is something new I learnt\\n13/09/2020, 2:15 pm - +91 97694 89970: Yessss right mahn.

But since then his progress came to a grinding halt.\\n\\nSeth\\'s doing fine at the small exercises—write a function here, reverse this list there—but when it comes to writing more substantial programs on his own, he just can\\'t get them to work.\\n\\nWhen Seth embarked on his \"coding journey\" a fire burned in his belly, but now he doesn\\'t really feel enthusiastic about anything.\\n\\nIt\\'s not like his motivation is dead and gone—\\n\\nEvery time he looks at the neat stuff he could use his programming skills for, he knows deep down that he WANTS to learn.\\n\\nBut the fire he once felt for Python and coding in general has faded into a dim glow at this point.\\n\\nSeth started out learning Python with a friend, but his friend surpassed him within three weeks. \\n\\nSeth still feels like a \"noob,\" and when his friend texted him a link to one of his little web app side-projects, Seth ignored the message for days.\\n\\nHow come Seth\\'s progress has been sitting at a standstill? How did he end up in this trap, feeling his stomach churn every time he thinks about writing another line of code?\\n\\nSeth says he simply has no idea *what* to program in order to get better. He has no project, nor an idea he wants to get started with. \\n\\nAnd he doesn\\'t feel comfortable coding the programs he thinks he *should* be able to code by now. There\\'s no going back or going forward.\\n\\nI call this \"Python Paralysis\"...\\n\\nWhen you\\'re tired of slogging through another coding tutorial, putting in more effort than most people, but STILL not seeing results... you know why most people don\\'t become professional programmers!\\n\\nThe real problem isn\\'t the effort itself, it\\'s all the other stuff that sabotages the effort.\\n\\nIf you\\'re wondering, I speak from experience here.\\n\\nSeth\\'s story is pretty much exactly how I felt in the beginning of any big challenge I ever tackled in my life, whether that\\'s learning how to program, getting my first coder job, or becoming self-employed and starting a business.\\n\\nIf you\\'re in the same spot right now, here\\'s what you need to realize:\\n\\nIf you get through this and keep pressing forward, you\\'re going to get to a stage that\\'s a whole lot better. Push through this, and your efforts will start paying off and people will start respecting you.\\n\\nIt takes guts and determination to make it past the \"paralysis\" and confusion. You need to have conviction, and a tolerance for pain. \\n\\nLet me ask you this: How do you KNOW you have a dream? Like, REALLY know it?\\n\\nWhen it hurts so bad that you can taste it. When you feel your heart lurch in your chest every time you think about the unfulfilled possibilities.\\n\\nThat\\'s when you need to keep pushing forward, that\\'s when you\\'re oh so close to getting your reward, but you don\\'t see it yet.\\n\\nDon\\'t throw in the towel. Keep pushing forward. \\n\\nAnd take another step towards your goal.\\n\\n— Dan Bader\\n27/09/2020, 2:37 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Guys,\\n2 min worth a read.\\n27/09/2020, 2:37 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Trust me\\n27/09/2020, 2:38 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): 👍\\n27/09/2020, 2:38 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): You read full?\\n27/09/2020, 2:38 pm - Hardik Raheja (TSEC, CS): 👌👌\\n27/09/2020, 2:39 pm - +91 86559 19035: Yep this is true\\n27/09/2020, 2:39 pm - +91 86559 19035: Every single word\\n27/09/2020, 2:40 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I can personally relate with this so much,\\nI just can\\'t express it out.\\nAll we should be doing at this point is keep pushing.\\n27/09/2020, 2:40 pm - +91 81696 22410: 🔥🔥\\nThanks for sharing this\\n27/09/2020, 2:40 pm - +91 86559 19035: Yes, I thought I was the only one in this stage\\n27/09/2020, 2:41 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): No brother.
